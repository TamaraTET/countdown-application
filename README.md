# countdown-application
This project is a custom countdown which allows users to enter a title for something they want to count down to. And then, there is an input date element or the handy date picker to pick a date, and click the "submit" button, which then pops up a countdown.

The project also gives users the option to reset the countdown, and select a date indicating the countdown is over, and click on the "submit" button, which then pops up a "countdown complete!" text animation, the title of the countdown and the date that it finished.

There is also an option of making a new countdown by clicking on the "NEW COUNTDOWN" button.

In addition, the project allows users to store their countdown information in Local Storage, such that if a user refresh the page or come back later to the page, the countdown will still be running.
